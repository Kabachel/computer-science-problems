## Introduction
Reading, fixing, testing and writing documentation from the material of the book "Classic Computer Science Problems in Java" authorship David Kopec.

## Goals
- [x] To study the main frequently occurring tasks from the field of `computer science` on the topics of `data structures`, `algorithms`, `artificial intelligence`.
- [x] Create project documentation using `Javadoc`
- [x] Write unit tests using `Junit5`
- [x] Configure code coverage reports generator for Java projects using `JaCoCo`
- [x] Set up automatic testing when pushing to the repository and uploading test coverage reports using 'Codecov'

## Documentation
You can view the project documentation at the link [DocPage](https://kabachel.github.io/computer-science-problems/)

## Tests
* Unit tests are implemented using [Junit5](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/) and coverage report with [JaCoCo](https://github.com/jacoco/jacoco) and CI with [Codecov](https://github.com/codecov).
To run use `mvn test`
