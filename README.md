## Introduction
Reading, fixing, testing and writing documentation from the material of the book "Classic Computer Science Problems in Java" authorship David Kopec.

## Goals
- [x] To study the main frequently occurring tasks from the field of `computer science` on the topics of `data structures`, `algorithms`, `artificial intelligence`.
- [x] Create project documentation using `Javadoc`
- [x] Write unit tests using `Junit5`
- [ ] Configure code coverage reports generator for Java projects using `JaCoCo`

## Documentation
You can view the project documentation at the link [DocPage](https://github.com/Kabachel/computer-science-problems/blob/8f219ad9db7b0e6b1a32c0cee44b5ed914df8109/javadoc/apidocs/index.html)

## Tests
* Unit tests are implemented using [Junit5](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/) and coverage report with [JaCoCo](https://github.com/jacoco/jacoco).
To run use `mvn test`
