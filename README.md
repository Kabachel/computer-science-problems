## Introduction

Reading, fixing, testing and writing documentation from the material of the
book "Classic Computer Science Problems in Java" authorship David Kopec.

## Goals

- [x] To study the main frequently occurring tasks from the field
  of `computer science` on the topics
  of `data structures`, `algorithms`, `artificial intelligence`.
- [x] Create project documentation using `Javadoc`
- [x] Write unit tests using `Junit5`
- [x] Configure code coverage reports generator for Java projects using `JaCoCo`
- [x] Set up automatic testing when pushing to the repository and uploading test
  coverage reports using `Codecov`
- [x] Codestyle - `Sun's Java Style`

## Documentation

## Tests

* Unit tests are implemented
  using [Junit5](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/) and coverage report
  with [JaCoCo](https://github.com/jacoco/jacoco) and CI
  with [Codecov](https://github.com/codecov).
